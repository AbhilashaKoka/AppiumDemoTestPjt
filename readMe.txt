WinAppDriver (Windows Application Driver) is a tool developed by Microsoft that
enables UI test automation for Windows applications.
 It functions as an Appium-compatible server,
 allowing users to automate interactions with Universal Windows Platform (UWP),
 Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF),
 Windows Forms (WinForms),
 and classic Windows applications.


Key aspects of WinAppDriver:


Requirements:
Windows 10 or Windows 11 operating system.
Developer Mode enabled in Windows settings.
A test runner that supports Appium,
such as MSTest with Visual Studio,
 or other frameworks like Selenium or Appium.


Functionality:
It exposes a WebDriver-like API for interacting with UI elements of Windows applications.
Allows identification of application elements, design of test scenarios,
and creation of test scripts using various programming languages (e.g., Python, C#, Java).
Supports execution of test scripts to simulate user interactions and capture results for analysis.

Installation and Setup:
Enable Developer Mode in Windows settings.
Download the Windows Application Driver (WinAppDriver) installer from the official Microsoft
GitHub releases page.
Install the downloaded .msi file.
Run WinAppDriver.exe from its installed location (typically C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Application Driver).



Usage:
Test scripts are written to interact with application elements using methods like FindElementByAccessibilityId().
Sessions are created to connect to the WinAppDriver server, and actions are performed within these sessions.
The WinAppDriver can be used as a standalone tool or integrated with existing Appium or Selenium frameworks.
